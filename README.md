Library Management System is an automated application designed to facilitate and manage library operations. It enables efficient interaction between users, books, and administrators, streamlining library processes.

The system utilizes the following key classes:

1. Book Class: This class represents books in the library. Each book has attributes such as a book number, title, author, publisher, etc. Users can search for books, borrow them, and return them.

2. User Class: This class represents library users. Each user has attributes like a username, password, full name, email, etc. Users can search for books, borrow them, and return them.

3. Administrator Class: This class represents library administrators. Administrators have privileges to manage the library system, including adding books, removing books, managing user accounts, and performing other administrative tasks.

4. Library Class: This class manages the core functionalities of the library management system. It handles user authentication, book search, borrowing, returning, and other library operations.

The Library Management System empowers users to efficiently manage library resources. Users can search for desired books, borrow them, and return them. Administrators have the authority to update the book collection, add new books, and manage user accounts.

This automation system replaces manual library processes with automated procedures, saving time and ensuring efficient management. Additionally, it keeps track of book borrowing and return activities, maintaining records and preventing delays.

The Library Management System offers a user-friendly interface for both administrators and users, enhancing library services and overall user satisfaction.
